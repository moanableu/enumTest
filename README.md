<h3>Radiohead Quiz</h3>

Learned so much with this!
<br>I was inspired by a similar project for which in the past I used SQL. For this quiz I use SQLite.
<br>I had great help from Leslie D. and Jonathan G. both based in VT -our tech community is great- and fellow scholar @Causaelity who has been a terrific mentor. 
<br>And of course @iip.udacity â€“ Iip.
