# enumTest

<h3>Radiohead Quiz</h3>

Learned so much with this!
<br>I was inspired by a similar project for which in the past I used SQL. For this quiz I use SQLite.
<br>A brief explanation of the classes used in this project:
<ul><li>QuizContract.java class that defines table schema</li>
<li>Question.java - class where enums, getters and setters are implemented</li>
<li>QuizDbHelper.java a class that <ol>creates table</ol><ol>upgrades table (triggered manually for now)</ol><ol>hosts all questions and answers</ol><ol>puts question information in table</ol><ol>creates an arrayList which reads information using Cursor object</ol></li>
</ul>
<br>The biggest learning curve was how to call enums, once used as a class everything becomes manageable. 
<br>One thing I am not trying here -looking forward to learn about it- is data persitencecy. 
<br>I had great help from Leslie D. and Jonathan G. both based in VT -our tech community is great- and fellow scholar @Causaelity who has been a terrific mentor. 
<br>And of course @iip.udacity â€“ Lip.
